To clone this repository and view it locally, navigate to the green 'code' button in the top right of the repository and use the drop down button to copy the repository's url. Then using your local command shell (example: terminal or gitbash), create the directory you'd like to add the repository to. Navigate into the directory using your command line. Execute the 'git clone' command followed by the url of the repository you copied. The repoistory should now be available inside the local directory you just created to view and edit or review the source code in your IDE.

# Usage
To use this application, navigate to the URL. Click the 'Add Task' button and enter the relevant information into the modal. Include a project title, select a due date from date picker, and include a descirption of your task or project. Once, finised, click 'save changes' on the bottom and then 'add task' to add to the task board. From there drag and drop the task into the correct column based on its current status: 'to do', 'in progress', or 'done'. The color of the task card should automatically update to reflect the current status.
